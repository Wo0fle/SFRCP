# Introduction

### SFRCP = Star Formation Rate Comparison Program

SFRCP is currently being used for a research project that I am revising: "Comparison of Star Formation Rate in Spiral versus Elliptical Galaxies."

The original research project was not as complete as I would have liked, so I decided to redo it with the goal of having more accurate and precise results.

It is currently a work in progress, so there are some problems with the code/results that I am working out.

**I will add a link to the research paper once I have completed the study and finished writing it!**

# Using/Editing the Program

SFRCP's data-retrieval script (`MEASURE SFR.ipynb`) has comments all throughout explaining each section!

As of now, SFRCP does not have a data-analysis script, but that is coming soon!

For more information on using/editing the program, check out [the wiki!](https://github.com/Wo0fle/SFR-Research-v2/wiki)
