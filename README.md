Hello!

This is the code that is currently being used for a research project that I am revising: "Comparison of Star Formation Rate in Spiral versus Elliptical Galaxies"

The original research project was not as complete as I would have liked, so I decided to redo it with the goal of having more accurate and precise results.

It is currently a work in progress, so there are some problems with the code/results that I am working out.

I will add a link to the research paper once I have completed the study and finished writing it!
