# "Super Galaxies" Explanation:

A "super galaxy" (in this study) is a set of data that is the average of every SFR measurement for a certain distance away from the center of each galaxy.

> I know that is probably pretty unclear, sorry!

For example, I took the raw data .csv files for all elliptical WISE 1 mean SFRs, took the first data point from each, took the mean of that, and added that to the WISE 1 Elliptical Mean SFR Super Galaxy. I then repeated this with the second data point, and the third, and so on until I used all data points in each galaxy. After all this, the WISE 1 Elliptical Mean SFR Super Galaxy was created!

I then repeated the process for all combinations of wavelength (W1, W3, etc.), galaxy type (spiral or elliptical), and mean/sum of SFR.
